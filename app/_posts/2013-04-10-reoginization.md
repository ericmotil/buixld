#Reoginization
Process is often shaped by how teams are organized.
In the context of designing for the multi-device web, the high level of iteration and communication required to build a modern website is rendering the assembly line approach obsolete and reorganization necessary. However, if a process is changed without rethinking the network of talent, resources, and management that support it, friction and inefficiency can arise.

Let’s assume that an assembly line process has 3 key phases: planning, design, and code, where each phase determines the next, and a project transitions primarily from strategy to execution.


Within this approach, teams are often structured to mirror the process. Planners (stakeholders, content strategists, management) define objectives and direction. Then, designers take the handoff to add form, hierarchy, and aesthetic. Finally, coders (front & back-end developers) execute the plan.


I think that this skill-based compartmentalization is one shortcoming of the assembly line. Locking developers and/or designers into a 100% execution role is a missed opportunity; ideally, every role contributes to strategy. Things like device compatibility and technical debt (typically in the realm of developers and often overlooked until the latter part of the project) should be a core part of strategic planning.

Teams compartmentalized in this fashion can have a difficult time iterating and exploring at a reasonable pace. For example, if developers need to schedule a meeting with designers and planners every time a layout change/breakpoint is needed during the coding phase, the iteration loop may extend from a few minutes to a few days. Traversing these compartmentalized phases and roles becomes cumbersome and time consuming, ultimately diminishing the potential for the final product.

If a process calls for multiple builds and rapid iteration, why not structure teams accordingly? I like the idea of smaller, tactical teams that are capable of executing multiple rounds of planning, design, and code quickly and independently.

##Discovery should be fun.
As web designers we need to know more about our clients than what typically fits in a brochure. So, if you get a .zip folder full of outdated tri-folds and TPS reports, ask for more. After all, no one really wants to build for a business he’s not excited about. And because it’s a two-way street, why not tip the scales of equal disclosure in your favor and start by telling your client about yourself or your team. Swapping backstories, working styles, values, and talents builds trust and sets the team up to become effective consultants. This can be conducted in whichever way works best for you. Make a webpage, video, pdf, or simply get on the phone.

In doing so, keep in mind that sparse or inaccessible discovery content can be just as unhelpful as the excessively wordy or over produced. To me, brand deck presentations with lens flare transitions, unsubstantiated info-graphics, and words like synergy, leverage, and the cloud are smoke and mirrors. If teams are going to work well together they’ve got to get real right off the bat. Be yourself and tell it like it is. What are the problems with the business or website currently? What aspects of either underperform? What are the stakes and criteria for evaluating success?

##Show & Tell Listen
Early in the planning process at Paravel, we love to show sketches or rough wireframes. The goal isn’t to get something approved as much as it is to start a discussion. It’s a simple, tiny thing, but within this discussion much can be achieved. With sketches, everyone is going to be less invested (in every sense of the word) than with fully comped layouts or fully built prototypes—therefore, team members aren’t afraid to pick things apart. As they share & debate ideas, the collaborative working relationship is established.

It’s amazing what you can learn by listening carefully to someone’s take on why something doesn’t work instead of cherry picking the things that do. Then, once a team agrees on where they are headed, they can start a dialogue about how best to get there, airing out specific differences in opinion and perception along the way.

##Correspond Effectively
I spend a lot of time trading feedback & planning via email or basecamp. I try to consistently edit things down and carefully consider tone as much as possible. It’s a valuable part of the work because it shows respect for both the collaborator’s time and the clear communication of ideas. Because Each person is different, so much of the correspondence is nuanced in tone to suit each personality.

However, certain topics can be more straightforward. I have, for instance, written the same message about the difficulties of implementing video on the web properly at least 6 times this year. The same goes for explanations on why we set responsive breakpoints to content rather than to device, or how no design technique or UI enhancement will ever make up for bad content. I’ve noticed that both the content and quality of these responses are influenced by focus levels, schedules, ringing phones, etc.. Ideally, I’d be able to take all the best points from each message and edit them into one concise response.

##Communication illustration
I have therefore decided to start indexing these brief explanations with links to supporting articles so that I can A) save time by reusing them, and B) build an easily updatable Paravel knowledge base. I should emphasize that something like this is not an attempt to automate collaborative relationships, but rather to enhance them by freeing up time to focus on the personal & specific parts of discussion. Also, I feel like an ass when I link to my own blog. That said, I’ve got a few ideas for how I might go about this.

-I could create a group in TextExpander, populating it with snippet explanations paired to hotkeys for quick access.
-I could create a folder of Markdown files, one file for each topic.
-I could create a simple WordPress blog, hosted either locally or online, creating a post for each explanation topic. Each entry would be tagged for quicker access if the amount of information grows over time.
