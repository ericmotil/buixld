#Where to Start
When making the transition to building responsive websites, the hardest part can be getting started.
I get my fair share of questions about how to choose a direction and chart out the first few steps from industry comrades and potential clients. It can seem daunting, so I thought I’d attempt to sum up a few of my own current thoughts on the matter.

Consider RWD From the Beginning.
I believe this starts with a shift in perception. Whether massive or minute, this shift usually involves letting go of a lot of assumptions that center around desktop-centric browsing. There is so little that we can actually count on: mouse pointers vs fat fingers, hover states, screen sizes, connection speeds, device capabilities, etc. What good is initial planning (content strategy, IA, sketching, prototyping) without considering all of the variables the multi-device web provides?

If a team is knee-deep in .PSDs before considering layout changes and alternate viewports, opportunities for optimization and innovation will be overlooked. I’d rather proactively embrace a new approach than try to shoehorn an old one.

Benefits of a Lengthy On-Ramp
If I were on a team organized around fixed-width desktop-centric production I wouldn’t want to be expected to immediately start building responsive sites at the usual pace. Taking time to fiddle with devices, hack code, and perhaps most importantly, time to think pays off in the long run. Giving teams and individuals a cushion to get back up to speed after taking a new direction helps instill a sense of purpose instead of panic.

This cushion could be in the form of extra time for reading and research, extra time budgeted into a project, or even better, a responsive hack week project. Imagine teams of 2-5 that build a responsive site on any fictitious topic they want.

We had to uproot a lot of what we were used to at Paravel, and there are only three of us. Processes and roles will change. Not everyone will be delighted about these changes all the time, so ease in and give team members time to learn by doing.

De-compartmentalize workflows.
I’ve mentioned this before, but ditching the assembly line method of site building for a more communicative, iterative process will be helpful. Team members learn from each other (fatten those T’s) and arrive at solutions more quickly when they work closely. Rather than a more traditional design and development departmental split, why not create small teams with both design and development talent? That way, when someone has a good idea, it can be designed and prototyped without the hassle of multiple handoffs.

##Discovery should be fun.
As web designers we need to know more about our clients than what typically fits in a brochure. So, if you get a .zip folder full of outdated tri-folds and TPS reports, ask for more. After all, no one really wants to build for a business he’s not excited about. And because it’s a two-way street, why not tip the scales of equal disclosure in your favor and start by telling your client about yourself or your team. Swapping backstories, working styles, values, and talents builds trust and sets the team up to become effective consultants. This can be conducted in whichever way works best for you. Make a webpage, video, pdf, or simply get on the phone.

In doing so, keep in mind that sparse or inaccessible discovery content can be just as unhelpful as the excessively wordy or over produced. To me, brand deck presentations with lens flare transitions, unsubstantiated info-graphics, and words like synergy, leverage, and the cloud are smoke and mirrors. If teams are going to work well together they’ve got to get real right off the bat. Be yourself and tell it like it is. What are the problems with the business or website currently? What aspects of either underperform? What are the stakes and criteria for evaluating success?

##Show & Tell Listen
Early in the planning process at Paravel, we love to show sketches or rough wireframes. The goal isn’t to get something approved as much as it is to start a discussion. It’s a simple, tiny thing, but within this discussion much can be achieved. With sketches, everyone is going to be less invested (in every sense of the word) than with fully comped layouts or fully built prototypes—therefore, team members aren’t afraid to pick things apart. As they share & debate ideas, the collaborative working relationship is established.

It’s amazing what you can learn by listening carefully to someone’s take on why something doesn’t work instead of cherry picking the things that do. Then, once a team agrees on where they are headed, they can start a dialogue about how best to get there, airing out specific differences in opinion and perception along the way.

##Correspond Effectively
I spend a lot of time trading feedback & planning via email or basecamp. I try to consistently edit things down and carefully consider tone as much as possible. It’s a valuable part of the work because it shows respect for both the collaborator’s time and the clear communication of ideas. Because Each person is different, so much of the correspondence is nuanced in tone to suit each personality.

However, certain topics can be more straightforward. I have, for instance, written the same message about the difficulties of implementing video on the web properly at least 6 times this year. The same goes for explanations on why we set responsive breakpoints to content rather than to device, or how no design technique or UI enhancement will ever make up for bad content. I’ve noticed that both the content and quality of these responses are influenced by focus levels, schedules, ringing phones, etc.. Ideally, I’d be able to take all the best points from each message and edit them into one concise response.

I have therefore decided to start indexing these brief explanations with links to supporting articles so that I can A) save time by reusing them, and B) build an easily updatable Paravel knowledge base. I should emphasize that something like this is not an attempt to automate collaborative relationships, but rather to enhance them by freeing up time to focus on the personal & specific parts of discussion. Also, I feel like an ass when I link to my own blog. That said, I’ve got a few ideas for how I might go about this.

-I could create a group in TextExpander, populating it with snippet explanations paired to hotkeys for quick access.
-I could create a folder of Markdown files, one file for each topic.
-I could create a simple WordPress blog, hosted either locally or online, creating a post for each explanation topic. Each entry would be tagged for quicker access if the amount of information grows over time.
