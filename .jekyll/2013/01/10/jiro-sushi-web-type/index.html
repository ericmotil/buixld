		<h1>Jiro, Sushi and Web Type</h1>

<p>One of my favorite documentaries is Jiro Dreams of Sushi, which tells the story of 85 year-old sushi master, Jiro Ono, who has spent his life honing his craft at a 10-seat restaurant in a Japanese subway station.
Jiro is the picture of craftsmanship and dedication and runs his restaurant as such, whether apprentices prepare egg sushi 200 times before meeting the standard or octopus is massaged for 50 minutes for tenderness. Even service is meticulously executed. Jiro places sushi in front of patrons and watches them carefully, modifying portion size and even placement to suit right or left-handed diners.</p>

<p>But beyond any of that, I was impressed with the relationships he has with his food providers. Because sourcing the highest quality ingredients is the foundation for Jiro’s craft, he recognizes and trusts each provider as the expert in his particular field—tuna, rice, shrimp, etc. The relationship is symbiotic; each must excel or neither will succeed.</p>

<p>I think this mirrors the web designers’ relationship to type designers. I don’t think anyone can deny that for our work on the web to be any good at all, we must have quality typefaces. Without them we are powerless.</p>

<p>Over the past 5 years, the importance of this relationship has become increasingly apparent. Before web fonts took off, I never gave font selection much thought. I chose from my web safe options (Georgia, Verdana, Helvetica, etc.) and moved on. Now that we have thousands of options whose quality varies greatly, I realize just how important it is to support type designers, enabling the creation of more, high-quality fonts and therefore better websites. The type designer’s role is instrumental to the success of our work.</p>

<p>Fostering this relationship clearly starts with respect. In the same way that Jiro trusts experts to provide him with the best materials so we should appreciate and value those devoted to the creation of quality web fonts. The more I work with web fonts, the more I learn about how difficult it is to make great ones. Time spent on letterforms, tracking, kerning pairs, and rendering makes or breaks a font. If quality takes time it also takes money, and I am personally happy to pay a fair price for such an invaluable resource.</p>

<p>Every time we obtain a font without a license, or perhaps even gripe about a fair price, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. If we want great web fonts, we must support their creation. When web type designers succeed, so do we.</p>

I agree with supporting type designers. I wish more of them let me serve their fish in my restaurant. This is changing for the better though.</p>

Trent, thank you. This sort of sentiment means a lot to type designers. Most of the time spent working on a typeface is put into making sure the reader doesn’t even notice the work of the designer, so when someone using our typeface takes note of our hard work, it makes us feel really special.</p>

<p>It is hard making typefaces for the web at present, mostly because the sand is constantly shifting under our feet. Believe us, we want see our fonts used on the web as much as you want to use it. It’s just that because type designers are a very detail-oriented lot—you mentioned our love for spacing and kerning above—we like to make sure every aspect of the font in the browser is the best it can be.</p>

<p>Eventually we might get to a place where fonts on the web are just as easy to use (or easier) than they are in desktop publishing programs. But we’ll only get there with web designers and type designers working together.</p>

Great article—it’s been wonderful to see the evolution of rich web typography in the past few years, and I feel that given the accessibility and volume of information on the web, typography will become even more important to pixelpushers.</p>

<p>It’d be cool to see websites maybe commissioning custom typefaces from foundries, as newspapers do now, and have more creative partnerships instead of a distant type-maker/type-user relationship.</p>
